Executive Order 14169 of January 20, 2025

Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:
Section 1. Purpose. The United States foreign aid industry and bureaucracy
are not aligned with American interests and in many cases antithetical
to American values. They serve to destabilize world peace by promoting
ideas in foreign countries that are directly inverse to harmonious and stable
relations internal to and among countries.
Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of United States that no further United
States foreign assistance shall be disbursed in a manner that is not fully
aligned with the foreign policy of the President of the United States.
Sec. 3. (a) 90-day pause in United States foreign development assistance
for assessment of programmatic efficiencies and consistency with United
States foreign policy. All department and agency heads with responsibility
for United States foreign development assistance programs shall immediately
pause new obligations and disbursements of development assistance funds
to foreign countries and implementing non-governmental organizations, international organizations, and contractors pending reviews of such programs
for programmatic efficiency and consistency with United States foreign policy, to be conducted within 90 days of this order. The Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) shall enforce this pause through its apportionment authority.
(b) Reviews of United States foreign assistance programs. Reviews of each
foreign assistance program shall be ordered by the responsible department
and agency heads under guidelines provided by the Secretary of State,
in consultation with the Director of OMB.
(c) Determinations. The responsible department and agency heads, in consultation with the Director of OMB, will make determinations within 90
days of this order on whether to continue, modify, or cease each foreign
assistance program based upon the review recommendations, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State.

(d) Resumption of paused development assistance funding. New obligations
and disbursements of foreign development assistance funds may resume
for a program prior to the end of the 90-day period if a review is conducted,
and the Secretary of State or his designee, in consultation with the Director
of OMB, decide to continue the program in the same or modified form.
Additionally, any other new foreign assistance programs and obligations
must be approved by the Secretary of State or his designee, in consultation
with the Director of OMB.
(e) Waiver. The Secretary of State may waive the pause in Section 3(a)
for specific programs.
Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed
to impair or otherwise affect:
(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or
(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.
