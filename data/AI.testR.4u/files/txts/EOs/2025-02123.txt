and deploy software, to participate in mining and validating, to transact
with other persons without unlawful censorship, and to maintain selfcustody of digital assets;

including through actions to promote the development and growth of
lawful and legitimate dollar-backed stablecoins worldwide;

(iv) providing regulatory clarity and certainty built on technology-neutral
regulations, frameworks that account for emerging technologies, transparent
decision making, and well-defined jurisdictional regulatory boundaries,
all of which are essential to supporting a vibrant and inclusive digital
economy and innovation in digital assets, permissionless blockchains, and
distributed ledger technologies; and
(v) taking measures to protect Americans from the risks of Central Bank
Digital Currencies (CBDCs), which threaten the stability of the financial
system, individual privacy, and the sovereignty of the United States, including by prohibiting the establishment, issuance, circulation, and use
of a CBDC within the jurisdiction of the United States.
Sec. 2. Definitions. (a) For the purpose of this order, the term ‘‘digital
asset’’ refers to any digital representation of value that is recorded on a
distributed ledger, including cryptocurrencies, digital tokens, and stablecoins.
(b) The term ‘‘blockchain’’ means any technology where data is:
(i) shared across a network to create a public ledger of verified transactions
or information among network participants;
(ii) linked using cryptography to maintain the integrity of the public
ledger and to execute other functions;
