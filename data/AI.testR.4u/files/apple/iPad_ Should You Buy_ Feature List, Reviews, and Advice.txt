4/25/25,  10:42 AM                            iPad: Should You Buy? Feature List, Reviews, and Advice 

  The iPad is Apple's most affordable and most popular tablet, and the 11th-generation model 

  features the A16 chip, a design with flat sides and a range of color options, an 11-inch display, 
   a USB-C port, and more, with prices that start at $349. 

   Introduced in March 2025, the 11th-generation iPad is at the beginning of its product 
   cycle, which means now is a good time to buy. 

  The iPad is Apple's most inexpensive iPad model for those who want a balance of features 
   and affordability, but users looking for a smaller iPad with better specifications should consider 

  the iPad mini, which starts at $499 and has a faster A17 Pro chip. On the other hand, for an 
   iPad with better specifications, there is the $599 iPad Air, which offers a faster M3 chip, 

  features like Stage Manager, and improved display technologies.

   How to Buy 

  The 11-inch 11th-generation iPad can be ordered from the online Apple Store and the retailers 
   starting at $349. 

   Design 

   With the launch of the 10th-generation iPad, Apple overhauled the design, introducing a look 
   similar to the iPad Pro and the iPad Air with an all-display design and no Home button, and 

   there have been no changes to that design with the 11th-generation iPad.

   There is an edge-to-edge display with slim bezels and an aluminum chassis with flat, rounded 

   edges, much like the iPad Air. The iPad 11 comes in four colors, including blue, pink, silver, and 
   yellow.

   The iPad measures in at 9.79 inches (248.6 mm) long, 7.07 inches (179.5 mm) wide, and 0.28 

   inches (7 mm) thick. It is just a bit bigger than the iPad Air, but a good deal thicker than its 
   6.1-mm sibling. It weighs in at 1.05 pounds (477 grams) with cellular models weighing just a 

   few grams more.

   Though there is an all-display design, the iPad does not use Face ID. Like the iPad Air and the 

   iPad mini, it has a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the power button. The fingerprint 
   sensor scans the finger much like a Touch ID Home button, but it is smaller and more 

   compact. Touch ID can be used to unlock the iPad, access apps, make purchases with Apple 
   Pay, and more. 

   There is a single-lens camera at the back of the iPad, a front-facing camera on the right side of 
   the front, along with speakers at the top and bottom, a microphone at the back, volume up 

   and down buttons at the side, a USB-C port for charging, and a Smart Connector along the 
   side edge for accessories.

4/25/25,  10:42 AM                                 iPad: Should You Buy? Feature List, Reviews, and Advice 

   Display 

   The iPad has an 11-inch Retina LED display with a resolution of 2360 x 1640 at 264 pixels per 

   inch. It is the least advanced display compared to the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini models, 
   which is how Apple keeps the iPad affordable. 

   Note that Apple says the iPad 11 has an 11-inch display while the iPad 10 had a 10.9-inch 
   display, but the display has not changed at all, and the difference comes from the way that 

   Apple has decided to round the display size. 

https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/                                                                                   7/21

4/25/25,  10:42 AM                           iPad: Should You Buy? Feature List, Reviews, and Advice 

  The display features 500 nits of brightness, and it supports True Tone. True Tone allows the 

  temperature of the display to change to be warmer or cooler, matching the lighting in the room 
  that you're in so there's not a stark difference between the color of the display and the 

  ambient light. 

  The display is also equipped with a touch sensor that allows it to work with the Apple Pencil, 

  and it has a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating. 

  A16 Chip 

  The iPad is equipped with an A16 chip that was first used in the iPhone 14 Pro models, but it is 

  worth noting that the A16 chip in the iPad 11 has a 5-core CPU, 4-core GPU, and a 16-core 
   Neural Engine. 

  The A16 chip is up to 30 percent faster than the A14 Bionic chip from the prior-generation 
   iPad. Apple says that the A16 is up to 6x faster than the best-selling Android tablet. 

  As the iPad has an A16 and not an A17 Pro or better, it does not support Apple Intelligence. 
  The A16 is capable of running Final Cut Pro for iPad, though, and it is an affordable way to 

  access professional video editing capabilities. 

   Storage 

  The iPad starts with 128GB of storage, a new minimum in 2025. There are also 256GB and 

   512GB upgrade options, and the 512GB option is new this year. 

   RAM 

  The iPad 11 has 6GB RAM, up from 4GB in the prior-generation model. 

   Battery Life 

  The iPad is equipped with a 28.6-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery, and it continues to offer 
   up to 10 hours of battery life when surfing the web or watching video. 

   Rear Camera 

  The iPad 11 uses a 12-megapixel Wide camera, which is the same camera that's in the iPad 
  Air. It has an ƒ/1.8 aperture, Smart HDR 4 support, Burst mode, Live Photos with stabilization,

   autofocus with Focus Pixels, wide color capture, exposure control, auto image stabilization, 

   noise reduction, and more. 

   4K video recording is supported at 20, 30, or 60 frames per second, as is slo-mo video at 120 

   or 240 frames per second. The iPad can also record in 1080p at 30 or 60 frames per second, 
   and it supports continuous autofocus, cinematic video stabilization, and the option to take 8- 

   megapixel still photos when recording 4K video.

   Though there's no TrueDepth camera system to support Face ID in the iPad Air, there is a 12- 

   megapixel Ultra Wide front facing camera with a 122 degree field of view and an ƒ/2.4 
   aperture. The camera supports Center Stage, designed to keep users perfectly framed on 

   screen during video calls. With the wider field of view, the camera can zoom in as appropriate 
   and follow people around the room as they move. 

   When other people join in on a call, the camera is able to detect them, and it zooms out to fit 
   everyone into the view. Center Stage is designed for FaceTime, but it also works with third- 

   party video apps like Zoom and Skype.

4/25/25,  10:42 AM                          iPad: Should You Buy? Feature List, Reviews, and Advice 

  The camera is positioned on the side of the iPad so that it is upright when in a landscape 

  orientation, similar to the camera on a MacBook. This is the first time that Apple has used this 
  particular camera orientation. 

   Other Features 

   5G 

  Cellular models of the 11th-generation iPad have a 5G chip that allows them to connect to 5G 
  networks, but it does not support the fastest mmWave 5G networks and is limited to the 

  slower but more widespread Sub-6GHz networks. 

  mmWave 5G networks are the fastest 5G networks, but mmWave is short-range and can be 

  obscured by buildings, trees, and other obstacles, so its use is limited to major cities and 
  urban areas along with venues like stadiums, arenas, airports, and other places where a lot of 

  people congregate. Sub-6GHz 5G is much more widely available and available in urban, 
  suburban, and rural areas across the United States and other countries. 

  The prior-generation iPad 10 supported eSIM and had a physical SIM slot, but the new iPad 11 
  only has eSIM for selecting a cellular network. 

  Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Sensors 

  The iPad supports 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3. The iPad includes a three-axis gyro, an 
  accelerometer, an ambient light sensor, and a barometer. 

   USB-C Port 

  The iPad is equipped with a USB-C charging port. The USB-C port in the 11th-generation iPad 
  is slower than the USB-C port available in the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini models. It is 

  limited to USB 2.0 speeds of up to 480Mb/s for data transfer. 

  Accessories 

  Apple Pencil 

  The iPad is compatible with both the $99 original Apple Pencil and the $79 USB-C Apple Pencil 

  that Apple announced in October 2023. 

https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/                                                                  11/21

   The Apple Pencil is a stylus that's designed to offer unparalleled precision and integration with 

   the iPad while also offering a natural feel that's similar to the sensation of using a pen or pencil 
   on paper. 

   There are pressure and positioning sensors built into the original Apple Pencil to allow it to 
   detect a range of forces for pressure-sensitive drawing and writing, but this feature is not 

   available in the USB-C Apple Pencil. Two tilt sensors in the tip of the Apple Pencil determine 
   the orientation and angle of the hand holding it, enabling shading techniques.

   The Apple Pencil offers a 12-hour battery life and it charges through the built-in Lightning 

   connector at the bottom of the device. A 15-second charge delivers a half-hour of power, so 
   it's always going to have juice when needed. 

   Because the first-generation Apple Pencil charges using an integrated Lightning connector, to 
   charge it with the iPad, a Lightning to USB-C adapter is required. The USB-C Apple Pencil has 

   a hidden USB-C port so it needs a USB-C cable to charge. 

   Magic Keyboard 

   Apple sells a $249 Magic Keyboard Folio alongside the iPad, with the accessory able to turn the 

   iPad into a mini notebook. It is a full-size keyboard with a built-in trackpad and a 14-key

   yet on which chip it will use, nor when it will come out. It is likely to launch in late 2026 or 
   early 2027.
